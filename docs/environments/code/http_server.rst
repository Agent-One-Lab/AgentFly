Code HTTP Server
================

The Code HTTP server provides a FastAPI-based execution environment for Python code snippets. It runs inside Docker containers and offers secure, isolated code execution with timeout and resource controls.

API Endpoints
-------------

Health Check
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**GET** ``/health``

Check if the server is running and ready to accept requests.

**Response:**
   - **200 OK**: Server is healthy
   - **Content**: ``{"status": "ok"}``

Execute Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**POST** ``/exec``

Execute a Python code snippet in the sandbox environment.

**Request Body:**
   - ``code`` (string): The Python code to execute

**Response:**
   - **200 OK**: Code executed successfully
   - **Content**: ``{"output": "..."}``
   - **400 Bad Request**: Code execution failed or syntax error
   - **408 Request Timeout**: Code execution timed out



Implementation Details
----------------------

The server uses a subprocess-based execution model:

1. **Process Spawning**: Each code execution creates a new Python subprocess
2. **Input Handling**: Code is passed via stdin to the child process
3. **Timeout Management**: Parent process enforces wall-clock timeouts
4. **Result Collection**: stdout/stderr are captured and returned
5. **Cleanup**: Process groups are killed on timeout or completion

The execution flow ensures that:

* No code can escape the sandbox environment
* Resource usage is strictly controlled
* Long-running or infinite loops are terminated
* Multiple concurrent executions are safely isolated
